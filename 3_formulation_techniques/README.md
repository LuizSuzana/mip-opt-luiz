# Formulation Techniques
In this module we will explore and practice some of the most classic 
formulation techniques that will serve as the foundation for you to 
formulate a big variety of problems.

Our approach is to study classes of problems. Each problem class may require 
unique techniques that, in the end, will compose our formulation tool-box.

We should mention that our goal goes beyond formulating and solving problems 
correctly. We also want to solve them efficiently. Therefore, we will also 
discuss implementation techniques and other strategies that may allow us to 
solve larger and more complex instances of these problems.
