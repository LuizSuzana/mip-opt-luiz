# Formulation Template
Soon we are going to be writing formulation for lots of problems. So it's 
important that we agree on some points right from the beginning. In particular,
we want to adopt similar styles to make communication easier as we move along. 

People use all sort of stiles to write mathematical formulation. Have a look 
at the [Formulation Styles](formulation_styles.ipynb) notebook for same 
classic examples (including examples of what you should NOT do).

To make your life much easier and help you to adopt the best practices from 
the start, we have prepared a [template formulation](formulation_template.ipynb)
that we use ourselves everytime we start a new project.
