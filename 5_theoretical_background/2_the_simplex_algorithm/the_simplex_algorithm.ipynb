This coefficient is called the *reduced cost* of $x_j$. In fact, if the reduced cost of $x_j$ is negative, then increasing $x_j$ will decrease the objective value, which is desirable since this is a minimization problem. On the other hand, if the reduced cost of every non-basic variable is non-negative, we conclude that the current solution is optimal."
