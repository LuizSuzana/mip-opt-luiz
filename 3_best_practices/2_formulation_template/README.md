# Formulation Template
Soon we are going to be writing formulation for lots of problems. So it's 
important that we agree on some points right from the beginning. In particular,
we want to adopt similar styles to make communication easier as we move along. 

People use all sort of styles to write mathematical formulation. Have a look 
at the [Formulation Styles](formulation_styles.ipynb) notebook for same 
classic examples (including examples of what you should NOT do).

To make your life much easier and help you to adopt the best practices from 
the start, we have prepared two templates:
- [Formulation Template (commented)](formulation_template_commented.ipynb): This 
  version comes with comments and is strongly recommended for beginners.
- [Formulation Template](formulation_template.ipynb): Same as the template 
  above but without comments. This version is recommended for those 
  already familiar with the template.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next module, we will practice a lot more formulation and 
implementation for a variety of applications.
