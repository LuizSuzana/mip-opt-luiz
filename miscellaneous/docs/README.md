# Course Details

Aster Santana will be the main instructor of this program. But we expect to 
have the participation of other experts in the field, such as special lectures, 
and even of other students, such as use case presentations.

### Time commitment
We will have one meeting per week of about 1-1.5 hours.
During these weekly meetings, we will discuss concepts and theory, practice 
with examples, answer questions, etc.

There will be no exams, quizzes, or any sort of testing. We assume that 
everyone taking this program is self-motivated and mature enough to decide 
how much they want to put into it. Nevertheless, we will suggest readings or 
exercises at the end of each meeting that might require 2-3 additional 
hours per week.

People with more time availability might want to take additional steps. We 
will support that as well, both in terms of content and availability to 
answer questions.

### Expected timeline:
- Introduction - 1 week
- Beginner Examples - 2 weeks
- Formulation Techniques - 6 weeks
- Theoretical Background - 4 weeks
- Handling Performance Issues - 2 weeks
- Exact Heuristics - 5 weeks
- **Total - 21 weeks**

This is a rough estimate, especially because this is the first time we are 
doing this program.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate in reaching out to Aster Santana 
directly.
