# Beginner Examples
Let's warm up with a few simple problems. Rather than solving complex 
problems, the goal at this initial stage is to get you familiarized with the 
thinking process, notation, and best practices that we will consistently use 
throughout the program.

The goal is to formulate, implement an optimization model, and analyze the 
solution for each problem.  

All these problems can be solved with linear programming, i.e., we 
don't need to use integer of binary decision variables, only continuous 
decision variables. Some of them can be even solved graphically.

- [PinkPig](https://www.mipwise.com/use-cases/pinkpig) - A contextualized 
  version of one of the most classic problems from the literature, the diet 
  problem.
- [SoyKing](https://www.mipwise.com/use-cases/soyking) - A beginner 
  transportation problem that will require the definition of decision 
  variables with two indices.
- [MarketUp](https://www.mipwise.com/use-cases/marketup) - A simple resource 
  allocation problem.
- [Black Blend](https://www.mipwise.com/use-cases/black-blend) - A 
  contextualized version of the classic blending problem.
- [Freshly](https://www.mipwise.com/use-cases/freshly) - A baby production 
  problem that reveals one of the challenges of dealing with real-world 
  problems that is handling quantities given in different units of measure.

In the next section, we will study classes of problems that are frequently 
encountered in applications.
