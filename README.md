# Mip Optimization

Welcome to the **Mip Optimization** program!

Mathematical optimization is an outstanding technology to solve 
decision-making problems. Here is a quote taken from the preface of the online 
book [Optimization Models][optimization_modes_book] by Fabio Schoen that 
summarizes it very well: 

>"Having the possibility of learning from data so that future trends (demand,
production, yield, interest rates, â€¦) can be reliably and robustly estimated 
is absolutely wonderful. However, after a reliable forecast becomes 
available, managers still need to take decisions. And this is where 
optimization (operations research) comes into play."

Before you move forward, we recommend that you read the following article to 
get some more context on what is waiting for you in the program:
