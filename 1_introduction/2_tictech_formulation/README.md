# TicTech Formulation
In this section we formulate a very simple problem, called *TicTech*,
to illustrate the basic steps in writing a mathematical formulation.

## Statement
Mr. Mip has been contacted by *TicTech*, an organization that is now going 
through a digital transformation and needs to make an important decision. 
They need to decide on the right type of technology that will support them 
making complex decisions as their business grow.

After reading a [blog][purpose-built-apps] about technologies for
decision-making, Mr. Mip arrived at three options:
1. Consulting services
2. Off-the-shelf software
3. Purpose-built web applications (Apps)

By analyzing pos and cons of each technology in the context of TicTech, Mr. 
Mip derived in collaboration with the client a score to each technology as 
follows: 

| **Technology ID** | **Technology** | **Score** |
|:-----------------:|:---------------|:---------:|
|         1         | Consulting     |    12     |
|         2         | Software       |    17     |
|         3         | Apps           |    25     |


What technology should be selected?

## Formulation
Because we need to write mathematical expressions, and LaTeX commands didn't 
get compiled in README files here in PyCharm by the time we wrote this, we use 
Jupyter Notebooks to write our formulations.

The formulation of the TicTech problem is in the 
[tictech.ipynb](tictech.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook. Take your time to go over 
the formulation and 
understand what's happening.
