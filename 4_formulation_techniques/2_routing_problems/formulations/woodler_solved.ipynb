The reason is that, even if truck $k$ isn't assigned to a order $l$, in which case $y_{kl}=0$, it still can visit site $s_l$ due to another order (with the same site) assigned to it, or even because the truck may need to simply pass by that site to get anywhere else.\n",

But we couldn't have this previous cycle AND also, say, S4 <-> S5, and this bad behavior is indeed impossible by the constraint above (for $S=\\{S4, S5\\}$).\n",
